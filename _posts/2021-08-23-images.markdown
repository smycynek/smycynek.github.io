I'm back working in CAD after a brief break, and one thing I see over
and over again in the industry is  [Parasolid](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/parasolid.html).  I recently heard a
co-worker explain that Parasolid was something on the order of a thousand person-years worth of development in geometric modeling, and given that
and that we all use it, I wanted to do something to honor this amazing fact.

To be clear -- I don't work for Siemens AG -- I found a Parasolid bug once,
that's about it.

Given my recent look at embedding data into physical objects with [UUI-Key](https://www.onshape.com/en/resource-center/innovation-blog/onshapers-take-a-turn-at-product-design-for-annual-cad-competition), I decided to go in a similar direction and look at the binary layout of the Parasolid library.

Here's what it looks like if you interpret 32-bit words as CMYK values.

![Parasolid](/assets/images/parasolid_kernel_composite.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

I refined this a bit more and made a collection of images of binaries you'll
probably recognize.

![Image grid](/assets/images/image_grid.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}


Here's the source for [Make Image](https://github.com/smycynek/make_image)

A few disclaimers:

1.  There are a many ways to encode and decode and interpret bytes in a binary
as pixels, and I wanted to use 4 bytes in a word for one color value, so I went
with CMYK.  Having said that, if you put a BMP or TIFF into this script, you'll
get back something that looks like the scrambled cable channels you tried to watch
as a teenager in the 90s.

2.  There is no embedded secret code or hidden agenda here.  Looking at data as pixels will reveal a few fun trends, mostly relating to the size of the file and if it has large sections of constant values, but character encoding and machine architecure has a lot to do with it, so don't read *too* much into any of the images :)  Having said that, I think the Parasolid image is the most beautiful,
but I'm biased.
