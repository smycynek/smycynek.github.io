I'm taking an advanced ReactJS class in a month, so I needed to
get back into front-end a little and remember everything I've forgotten.

I've been playing a lot of chess with my daughter, and I love chess puzzles,
the kind you see in newspapers and books that prompt you to pick the best move
for white or black or explain why a certain move won't work.

I don't think I can get into hosting or connecting to an engine like [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) right now, but given the theme of 'post and share' I had
from [QuizWiz](https://stevenvictor.net/quizwiz), I thought, why not a puzzle site?

So, my first attempt is at [https://www.stevenvictor.net/chess/](https://www.stevenvictor.net/chess/)

There was a mistake in one of the puzzles early-on, and within hours,
someone was making fun of it on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/l6noh2/if_they_didnt_tell_me_my_rook_was_pinned_to_my/)  I was flattered :)

The code isn't as clean as I like -- modeling ranks and files is basically
an invitation for off-by-one errors :), but I felt like sharing anyway.

Next, I want to make an authoring tool and a back-end to store submissions.

[Here's what I have so far for authoring.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oczqku-iEq4)  I want to clean up the CSS and merge this with the puzzle viewing page before it goes online.
