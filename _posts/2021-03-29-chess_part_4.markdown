More updates on my [chess site](https://stevenvictor.net/chess)!

The big changes are:

1. More consistent UI (margins, button styles, text styles...)
2. Much nicer share buttons to post to SMS, Twitter, and other media
3. Drag and drop support on desktop -- no mobile yet :)
4. More sample content

I've gotten some great feedback as well:

* [r/ChessPuzzles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChessPuzzles/comments/mdm2nh/my_chess_puzzle_app_now_supports_drag_and_drop/)

* [r/ChessProgramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/chessprogramming/comments/ll8idt/chess_puzzle_site_looking_for_feedback/)

* [r/ChessPuzzles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChessPuzzles/comments/lcpauh/chess_puzzle_tool_improvements_now_with_post_and/)

* [r/ChessPuzzles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChessPuzzles/comments/l63lt3/my_own_chess_puzzle_site_minimal_but_just_getting/)

I still need to work on mobile touch support for dragging.  For now, tapping on mobile
will have to do.  I'd also like to break up some of the UI components, like the toolbars,
partially so can have them float and realign around the board.

I've gotten a request to link to an engine for analysis, but that will take more time :)
