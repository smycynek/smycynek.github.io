I'm currently distributing my book to various audio book platforms.
What's funny is that it takes 2-4 weeks for the content to go live.  

My suspicion is that given that it costs me nothing to distribute them, most providers use Amazon glacier storage or some other slow moving process, sort of like an ACH transfer, to move the data around.  The current list is at <https://stevenvictor.net/books/>
