In my last post, I talked about how I read through [WebGL Programming Guide](https://www.amazon.com/WebGL-Programming-Guide-Interactive-Graphics/dp/0321902920/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3G6M77ZE1F2UY&keywords=programming+webgl&qid=1641390115&sprefix=programming+webgl%2Caps%2C50&sr=8-3), and I made [this project template](https://stevenvictor.net/glta/), as most of the WebGL tutorials use ancient HTML and JavaScript.

I also started on [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Computer-Graphics-Steve-Marschner/dp/0367505037/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=fundamentals+of+computer+graphics&qid=1641390177&sprefix=fundamentals+of+computer%2Caps%2C76&sr=8-1).

At the same time, I did some modeling of chess pieces in [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com) and created some 3D renders as well:

![Kasparov vs Deep Blue](/assets/images/kasparov_vs_deep_blue.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Here are the [Onshape models](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1ac43c0042a8a0544e84feed/w/276b025152b1f726b298cef5/e/c3193025dfaf1a651f190a93?configuration=List_bGoI1y3jF0OqLo%3DPosition&renderMode=0&uiState=627c56b1bac013545b5857c4)

Here are the [STL files](https://stevenvictor.net/chess_stl/) if you want to 3d print them.

All of this was to prepare for my next project, 3d-chess puzzles.

Here's [a sample puzzle on stevevictor.net/chess3d](https://stevenvictor.net/chess3d/?question=What%20move%20by%20white%20shows%20three%20tactics%20at%20once%3F&answer=Os6:%20%20Qvfpbirerq%20nggnpx,%20sbex,%20naq%20qbhoyr%20purpx&data=wKh1,bNf1,wPh2,wPg2,wRh3,wNb3,bBc3,wBh4,bBa4,bPb4,wPc5,bRb5,bPb6,bPa7,bPf7,bKh8&editMode=true)

There's a long way to go -- this site doesn't pan, zoom, tilt, or allow drag/drop editing, but going from almost no graphics programming to this in a couple months has been a lot of fun.
