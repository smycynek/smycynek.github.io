My daughter is doing ten-frame arithmetic in school, so we made a ten-frame together.  A [ten-frame](https://www.twinkl.com/teaching-wiki/ten-frame) is sort of a simplified abacus that many
schools use to teach basic counting, addition, and subtraction.

It was so much fun, I decided to design a kit for making your own ten-frame.
My goal is to make a kit for under five dollars, ideally two or three, and provide easy instructions for parents or teachers and kids to work through together.

The instructions are pretty basic --
an experienced woodworker might not find the project terribly interesting, but the main point is to do something interactive and educational with your kids.

### About
One of my hobbies is developing software that is free, fun, easy to use instantly, often educational, and has no advertisements.
It drives me crazy when I see an ABCs app for the iPad that pushes toy advertisements or has a pay-wall to get the
entire alphabet!  However, I would be remiss if I did not mention my employer, [PTC/Onshape](https://www.onshape.com) for the opportunity they have given me to develop the Onshape cloud-based CAD tool alongside their amazing team, which has free-to-use plans for individuals and educational institutions.  CAD is an important part of my career and helps me realize many of my ideas, so any chance I get to share that with others is a good day.
