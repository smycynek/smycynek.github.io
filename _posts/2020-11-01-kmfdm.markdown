I wanted to do a little more CSS and SCSS, so I finally got
around to doing something I've always wanted -- an album cover
generator: <https://stevenvictor.net/kmfdm>.  I was reminded of
this when I was adding a few enhancements to the alphabet flashcard app <https://stevenvictor.net/abc>.  

I love it when non sequiturs or random value sets up the perfect punchline.
Here a a few of the funnier ones.

There's still plenty to do on this.  The color values are duplicated between the css and the javascript.  I need get the image download button working on mobile.  I want to add some more SVGs that can pass for the style of Adrian Hughes.

The app is still good enough and fun enough to share, though.
Have fun!
