I hoped to do a little more CSS and SCSS, so I finally got
around to something I've always wanted  -- an album cover
generator: <https://stevenvictor.net/kmfdm>.  I was reminded of
this when I was adding a few enhancements to the alphabet flashcard app <https://stevenvictor.net/abc>.  

The band [KMFDM](https://kmfdm.net)  has a very specific and recognizable style,
and they also love a little bit of self-referential
and self-deprecating humor.  I also love it when non sequiturs or random value sets up the perfect punchline. Here a a few of the funnier albums I created with some SVGs
from FlatIcon.com.

I'm sure there are plenty of good ways to display one of many SVGs randomly, but what I did was:

1.  Scale all of them down a bit.
2.  Run them through <https://react-svgr.com/> to make them into react components
3.  Concatenate all components into one file, and export an array of components.
4.  Add in a parameter to set the fill color.
5.  Pick a component at random from the array.

There's still plenty to do on this.  The color values are duplicated between the css and the javascript.  I need get the image download button working on mobile.  I want to add some more SVGs that can pass for the style of Adrian Hughes.

The app is still good enough and fun enough to share, though.
Have fun!
