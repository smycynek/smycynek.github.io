Finding an activity you can do with your children that is
enriching for them and something you both relate to is always a bit of an experiment.

Recently, I decided to make an interactive ABC website with my young daughter.  I took pictures of all the letters, A-Z, that she printed in crayon.  I then recorded her speaking each letter and a that started with each letter.

The result is below!

I'll admit I did this partially just to see if I could get it all done in one afternoon.  Of course, after that, there were a lot of tweaks, especially with mobile and CSS.  The code itself is nothing too complex, but it was a lot of fun for both my daughter and I.  I encourage you to take this source and replace it with your own images and audio -- send me a link to the results!
