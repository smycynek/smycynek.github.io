Finding an activity you can do with your children that is
enriching for them and something you both relate to is always a bit of an experiment.

Recently, I decided to make an interactive ABC website with my young daughter.  I took pictures of all the letters, A-Z, that she printed in crayon.  I then recorded her speaking each letter and a word she chose that started with each letter.

The result is below!

Users can go backward and forward through the alphabet to see and hear pairs of letters and words as well as select a specific letter from the list at the bottom of the page.

Here's the source:

I'll admit I did this partially just to see if I could get it all done in one afternoon.  Of course, after that, there were a lot of tweaks, especially with mobile and CSS.  The code itself is nothing too complex, but it was a lot of fun for both my daughter and I.  I encourage you to take this source and replace it with your own images and audio -- send me a link to the results!

One usability challenge was telling the user that they can click on just a letter or noun image to hear just a letter or noun.  I didn't want too much text on the page other than the ABCs, so the user will need to explore this a bit.

A few implementation notes: The Web Audio API on mobile is a little tricky.  Because of end-user concerns, iOS often refuses to play audio without some initial specific user interaction that meets certain criteria (to prevent obnoxious audio/video from playing automatically when a page loads)  So, that's why there's a "Get Started" button :)  I also pre-fetched all the images (see the source) so they hopefully load pretty quickly.
