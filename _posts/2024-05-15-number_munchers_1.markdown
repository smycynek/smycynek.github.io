As I've mentioned, I like to do small projects on airplanes to see
what I can do in a short time with no Internet access to look things up.

I recently created a simple number-munchers-like game.
It was very primitive and all HTML and VanillaJS, but it was
fun, and people liked it.

I made a nicer version in Angular
when I got home.

The response has been amazing!  I am thrilled that parents and
children are getting something out of this.  I'll continue to make
small enhancements when I can.
